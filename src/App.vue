        <p>
          This campaign takes your party to Pohjola, a barren northern region based on Finnish mythology and
          folk lore. The campaign plays on DnD 5th Edition rules, and it introduces some new enemies, spells
          and items. The main inspiration for this work comes from the Finnish national epic Kalevala,
          composed by Elias Lönnrot, and Martti Haavio's studies of Finnish mythology. The story lines are
          partly or completely fictional and do not depict the original stories of Finnish folk lore. Some of
          the ideas have been loaned from the old stories, poems and songs philologists have recorded from
          singers and sages of the past. My intent was to paint a picture of this long gone world while
          stretching its stories and contexts a bit, just to make things more interesting. I'm not an expert
          of Finnish mythology, but just an engineer who recently started DnD and enjoyed it so much that
          decided to write his own story.

          Please also note that some of the symbols in this story are used by Finnish neo-nazis and other hate
          groups as "their" symbols. I don't want anything to do with these groups and I respect all people
          despite their religion, gender, color, or any other property. Hateful people also, because I believe
          they will come to their senses some day.

        <chapter-title name="Creation of the World" />
        <p>
          In the beginning there were only gods. Among them, was goddess Ilmatar, the goddess of air. In her
          loneliness, she became bored and descended from the skies on to the waves of the sea. She was
          pregnant and in pain. The birthing would not proceed as expected and she was starting to become
          desperate. Meanwhile, a bluebill was circling the skies looking for a place to nest and lay her
          eggs. She was also in a hurry and had been looking for a suitable place a while. The bluebill spots
          the knee of Ilmatar above the sea waves and sees it as a suitable (or at least passable) place for a
          nest. The nest was built and eggs laid, 6 golden ones and one made of iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          After three days of hatching, also Ilmatar started to feel the bluebill. Ilmatar felt increasing
          heat that first was comfortable, but after a while it became stinging and soon her knee felt like
          burning. Like any creature, even a god, would do, she moved her knee under the sea waves to cool it
          off. The bluebill took off and her eggs broke down into tiny pieces which rolled into the sea. The
          small egg shell pieces did not get far. After touching the sea water they started to transform: the
          bottom halves of shells turned to clay, dirt, and stone, the building blocks of ground, and top
          halves built up the first sky. The brown parts of the shell became the day and sunlight, when white
          transformed into night and the moon. The night also received its stars of colored crumbs, and the
          blackest crumbs turned into clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
          After nive years, Ilmatar, still pregnant, started to mold the crude first world. She placed
          continents, islands and shores, formed the sea bottom and coasts. However, all this work still did
          not trigger the birth of her child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirty more years did the child spend in her mother's womb. Finally, the offspring decided it was
          time go and step into the world. So it did, but little did it expect the cold sea that was her
          mother's new home. The child of goddess fell into the raging sea and spent eight years in the waves
          until they threw him on a deserted cape. There he rose and finally looked at the world in peace. So
          was born the world, and Väinämöinen, the eternal sage.
        </p>

        <chapter-title name="Pohjola" />
        Pohjola ("northern place") is a large island far north and is home to the mistress of Pohjola and a
        powerful witch Louhi, her beautiful daughter and their people. In the beginning, Pohjola was very
        barren, gray and lifeless place. However, a people was able to survive there with the help of their
        leader's magical powers. If the land was gray, lifeless and gloomy, Louhi's daughter was quite the
        opposite. The word of her great beauty travelled also to the ears of Väinämöinen, who decided to
        travel to the north after her hand. When crossing the sea, Väinämöinen is attacked by his young
        brother Joukahainen who envies his singing abilities and great wisdom. Joukahainen shoots
        Väinämöinen's horse with a bow and Väinämöinen falls into the sea (apparently it really was a horse,
        not an over-sized sea horse). Väinämöinen drifts to the beaches of Pohjola and manages to find Louhi's
        daughter, who however, has no interest for the gray old man. Väinämöinen has trouble getting back to
        south without his horse but Louhi promises to take care of it if Väinämöinen creates a Sampo for her.
        A magical artifact that produces endless amounts of grain, salt and gold just by rotating a lever.
        Sampo is often described as sort of a mill. For the sake of simplicity, that's what it will be in this
        document. Väinämöinen, in all his wisdom, realized that he is not able to create this artifact. He
        needs the help of his brother Ilmarinen, the forger of the sky dome, the eternal smith. He sings a
        spell and tricks Ilmarinen to climb on top of a spruce. Another spell produces a terrible wind that
        flies Ilmarinen all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen is not happy about this little trick but when Louhi
        offers her daughter's hand for him, he promises to try creating Sampo. After great effort and multiple
        tries he is able to create Sampo, a golden mill with lid of many colors, and three nozzles. One for
        each produced good. Louhi is pleased that she will finally be able to provide plentiful life for her
        people and locks the device into a mountain and secures it with nine locks. Ilmarinen requests the
        daughter's hand but the proud daughter is not pleased with Ilmarinen either. Both men return home
        without brides. Later Väinämöinen realizes that Pohjola has now everything they need for living and
        part of the richnesses should be spread across the world. So, with Ilmarinen and a young man called
        Lemminkäinen, they sail to Pohjola to demand part of the profits. Louhi is enraged by the demand and
        threatens the party but Väinämöinen plays his harp made of giant pike's jaw bone and sings a powerful
        spell that puts all people of Pohjola to sleep. They are able to set sail back towards south with the
        wondrous Sampo. Lemminkäinen persaudes Väinämöinen to sing for their great achievement but they are
        celebrating too soon. A common crane hears the singing and shrieks loudly which wakes the people of
        Pohjola. They start the chase with a warship. Pohjola's warship reaches the escapees but Väinämöinen
        is not giving up. He sings another spell and plucks his harp. A shoal appears to the front of the
        chasers' ship and the ship starts to sink. However, Louhi knows spells too and transforms into a giant
        eagle, takes few of her men on her back and continues the chase. A fight ensues during which Sampo
        accidentally falls into the sea and breaks into pieces. It is common knowledge that the pieces of
        Sampo spread with sea currents and fertilized lands, accelerated growth of vegetation, and made living
        easier in many ways also in Pohjola.

        <section-title name="In Dungeons & Dragons context" />

        I would say Pohjola is a demiplane created by Louhi. Väinämöinen also created his own called Kaleva,
        but it is not part of this adventure (yet). A large seas surrounds both and a portal connects the seas
        far out on the open sea where one can see no land.

        <section-title name="More history" />
        As told, destruction of Sampo changed Pohjola tremendously. Instead of rocky barren fields, there are
        now green plains in the heart of the land, marshes in the east and bare rocky shores in the west.
        Rivers cross the island from south to north west and along it Kalevans have built large cities, forts
        and smaller settlements. During the winter, the snowy areas of north spread south but the southern
        most point of the island tends to stay warmer. People started to inhabit Kaleva and Pohjola with
        increasing pace. Pohjola started to thrive as well and its people spread around the island. However,
        Kaleva people had a head start and soon their island started to feel inadequately small. Kalevans
        invaded Pohjola and drove metsäläiset, the aboriginals of Pohjola, to north, away from fertile lands
        to live on mining and hunting. Kalevans farmed, hunted and thrived. They built large cities and
        settlements around the island but left the north to metsäläiset. Kalevans were content buying metals
        and gemstones from metsäläiset and selling some grain in exchange. During the centuries, many people
        sought wisdom from the elders of Pohjola and Kaleva. Witches commonly visited Louhi to answer their
        questions. Väinämöinen was also visited but he has a more important mission than seeing fortunes or
        helping with mortal problems. Soon after the invasion, he had decided to prison the god of chaos,
        Perkele. Perkele and its demons, kapes, were a daily source of havoc and misery in Pohjola, as they
        tried to interrupt settlers from organizing and building their new communities. Demon raids were
        common and in the end, kapes "ate the moon" by concealing it with a spell and it was common belief was
        that sun would be next target. Väinämöinen wanted to do one more favor for his people. With the help
        of his brother Ilmarinen and the gods of Pohjola, he managed to imprison Perkele under lake Iänlampi.
        The jail was shut with magical key called Tursaansydän, that is a large amethyst cut into shape of
        four tangled arrows. This key was split into four pieces that were hidden in Pohjola. This was done as
        insurance if Perkele would be needed once again for some yet unknown reason. A spell protects the
        pieces. They can open the cell only when joined to the original shape, but the key also can only be
        destroyed when it is whole.

        <captioned-figure :path="tursaansydan" caption="Rough sketch of Tursaansydän" width="20rem" />

        <section-title name="Today" />
        Kalevans have lived hundreds of years in peace and abundance. There has been enough grain, beer, game
        and resources for all their people and a hard-working people have always been able to earn their
        living. Only occasional raids of barbarians have interfered with their bliss. Hence, disturbance in
        the supply lines causes easily confusion and restlessness. Metsäläiset have resiliently inhabited the
        north all this time and grown in numbers. Now they have reached such state that their leader, Mistress
        Loviatar, believes that they can take back what belongs to them with the help of Joukahainen and
        Perkele. They plan to take over Pohjola, even though it would require releasing chaos into the
        demiplane and even sacrificing the sun and the moon. Most kalevans have forgot the stories of the old
        and believe that metsäläiset are the evil of this island which was banished successfully from their
        lands. Revealing that kalevans were originally invaders creates an interesting twist to the story when
        the truth is revealed to the party.

        <chapter-title name="Prisoners of Gundarlun" />
        This is the first game play chapter of this campaign.

        <read-aloud>
          Gundarlun. Tuulen ja jään hallitsema saari keskellä Vanattoman valtamerta. Olette Ainkesän Vartion
          vankeina päätyneet tähän syrjäiseen unohdettujen valtakuntien kolkkaan Gundarlunin pohjanmiesten ja
          Ainkesän kaupungin kauppasopimuksen johdosta. Rangaistuksena teoistanne etsitte nyt kuparia
          mantereelle toimitettavaksi, josta Ainkesälle on sopimuksen nojalla luvattu suurin osa työvoimaa
          vastaan. Saarelle saapuminen on vaikeaa jatkuvan pakkasen ja purevan tuulen vuoksi, mutta niin on
          myös sieltä poistuminen, mikä tekee siitä käytännöllisen rangaistuslaitoksen. Gundbargin kaupungin
          länsipuolella, jäätikön peittämän vuoren rinteellä sijaitsee kaivos ja yhdessä sen syvimmälle
          ulottuvista haaroista tunneli A-704. Hakkujen tasainen kilkatus poukkoilee kapean tunnelin reunasta
          reunaan äänien vaeltaessa pimeyteen. {Ryhmän jäsenluku} olentoa heilauttaa ensin työkalunsa ylös, ja
          kuin toisiinsa kytkettyinä hakut heilahtavat kiveä vasten. Hakkujen lisäksi voi kuulla vain
          jalkakahleiden kolinaa ja satunnaisia murahduksia. Joukko etenee hitaasti mutta varmasti kohti
          vuoren syvyyksiä yhden lepattavan soihdun valossa.

        <read-aloud>
          This is Gundarlun. An island in the middle of Trackless Sea ruled by wind and ice. You are prisoners
          of Neverwinter Guard and ended up to this remote location due to a trade agreement between
          Neverwinter and Gundarlun northmen. As your punishment, you are now searching for copper of which
          most will be sold to Neverwinter in exchange for workforce. This island is in the middle of a sea
          and is protected by strong winds and biting cold. Travelling here is challenging but so is leaving,
          which make Gundarlun an excellent penitentiary. West of the city of Gundbarg, on the slope of an icy
          mountain is a mine, and in one of its deepest branches, tunnel A-704. At the end of this tunnel a
          party of X creatures swings their pickaxes in a steady rythm. In addition clangs of pickaxes, one
          can only hear the clatter of prisoners' chains and occasional grunts and sniffle. The party advances
          slowly but steadily towards the heart of the mountain.
        </read-aloud>

        Explain your players that they are a new unit that has just been chained together and formed a new
        prospecting group whose task is exploring new valuable areas. Newcomers are usually sent to the
        deepest tunnels but some of them may have ended there e.g. due to crimes or maybe they are framed of
        one. Encourage the players to introduce themselves, tell about their background and why they are
        imprisoned. Days pass and the party digs on. Nights they spend on sleeping under jute blankets, and
        twice a day they eat dried meat and crackers. Every few days a group of supervisors arrives to see the
        progress, document any new signs of copper deposits and to bring new supplies.

        <read-aloud>
          After six days of digging, a new kind pickaxe sound alerts the party. One of the players has hit
          their pickaxe through the cave wall. A small hole has appeared to the wall and behind it is a large
          and dark cavern.
        </read-aloud>
        <p>
          If the party steps through the hole, they are arrive to a high corridor. Its walls are large stone
          blocks and their gaps have filled with ice. All the surfaces are covered in dust and pieces of ice
          have fallen from the walls and ceiling onto the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can also wait or fetch supervisors but then the supervisors will tell them to lead the way into
          the hallway. DC10 Perception check for markings on the walls. On success hey find a drawn eye that
          watches towards the deeper end of the hallway. Another way used to lead outside but has since
          collapsed shut.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking towards the open end of the corridor, the party is greeted by a large, dark, and gloomy
          cave. Outside of the torch light they can hear faint rythmic thumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the party proceeds, they will see a stone altar on the other side of the room. Altar has some
          items on it, like a bear skull and ash but they cannot be recognized from afar because everything is
          covered in dust and ice. In front of the altar is a drum, with a ring of wood and head of leather.
          It has black drawings of animals and people on the leathery head. The drum plays by itself with
          heartbeat like rhythm. The drum is the only thing in the room without a cover of dust. Next to the
          drum is a longish lump but the party can't see what it is. On further inspection they find a
          skeleton clad in a robe that has another hand below its head as in a sleeping position. The party
          has found a deceased witch who once cast a spell to enter the world of the dead but did not wake up
          from the spell. Ancient witches were able to visit other planes with spells that make the witch to
          lose her consciousness and enter the mind of another creature like an animal to enter the realm of
          the dead. They often visited wiser beings to seek answers to questions living had represented to the
          witch. Witches usually had an assistant that made sure that the witch would wake up and return back
          to their own world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case the assistant failed or betrayed the witch, or maybe the witch never intended to
          return. If the party touches the hand or the drum, the hand grasps them. The same spell the witch
          had used activates and transfers the whole party to Pohjola, the material plane of the underworld
          (because they are chained together!). In real world the characters fall unconscious one by one.

        <read-aloud>
          You see restless dreams. You run through a forest with a wolf pack. Soar through the skies in a snow
          storm. Scramble through shoulder-high snow. Skitter through city streets while dodging giant feet.
          You keep on jumping from dream to dream, unable to wake up. Suddenly, dream ends and you open your
          eyes. You all are laying on mossy ground of a spruce forest. The sun peeks between the tree branches
          and the only voice you hear is the soft wind in the trees.
        </read-aloud>
        The party has woken up in Pohjola. They are few kilometers from Bluebill's Nest where they should find
        themselves soon enough, one way or another. The party is still in shackles. Pohjola has their own
        gods, habits and culture. They know nothing of other lands and the knowledge of plane travellers, like
        our party, has long since forgotten. If the party asks about their situation the common folk should
        think they are crazy or laugh at them. They may refer to fairy tales where witches from other lands
        arrive to Pohjola to do evil. Of course these tales were once true, but this hasn't happened for over
        hundred years.
        <area-title name="Bluebill's Nest (Sotkala)" />
        Bluebill's Nest is a small village which lives of fishing and hunting and trading with occasional
        travelers. A major road and river bypass the village so there is usually quite a bit of traffic.
        However, not many are willing to live this far away from major cities. Hunting and fishing are not
        that prolific professions either so the houses are modest and simply built log cabins. There are 11
        smaller cabins and one larger, the White Rabbit Inn. One of the other smaller houses has wooden stands
        in front with fishes drying out in the morning sun. There is an old man repairing fishing nets on the
        porch. To north starts the road to the city of Sword, which follows the south bank of Fuller river. To
        the north is the road to the Gray Keep, Halla farm and the city of Brass Buckler. To the east is
        Hallasuo, huge marshland with just few inhabitants. To the west is river Viper's Rend (Kyynsärö).
        <sub-area-title name="Courtyard" />
        <read-aloud>
          The dirt courtyard is in the center of the line of houses. On its edge is a well but otherwise the
          yard doesn't seem to get much use. However, now there are four
          <id-link id="monster-soldier-of-the-sword" name="guards" type="monster" /> cleaning their boots and
          chatting. A fancy looking wagon stands next to the road and a young human man steps around

          thinks of himself as a prince and plans to travel to the court of Eteläterä to gain influence. He
          has been assigned to the Gray Keep since teenage and now that he has reached adulthood, it is his
          time. He has no time for mere peasants and want's to get moving as soon as possible. He plans to
          benefit from the unstable situation of the Blade and raise his ranks amid political chaos. He won't
          share his intent except if the party allies with him in the future. Kaino is able to tell the party
          about the turmoil in Sword cities. Two families descendants of the last Sword King are at each
          other's throats after Eteläterä's heir Armas Eteläterä fell to his dead from castle tower. The court
          of Eteläterä is suspicious of Pohjanterä. He doesn't mention that the Fuller river (Veriura) which
          flows between the two cities has changed color, tastes foul and reportedly causes sickness of
          children and weak of health. Pohjanterä court rumours that Eteläterä poisoned the water as revenge
          and the southern half-king has a secret source of clean water or a way to purify it. Secretly he
          thinks that the death of the heir is his chance to become the new heir.

          He want's to be viewed as a prosperous man, but the times have been rough. He was forced to flee the
          twin-cities of Sword because of his drunken babbles that offended one of the half-kings. An
          informant snitched and now he is wanted by the Arm, the city guard. He plans to move towards south,
          to the Gray Keep. Now he is trying to make enough money here to continue by selling made-up stories
          to the gullible. There is a price for him in the Sword cities, so the party may catch him at some
          point. No-one in the village knows about the price though. Veli has rented a room upstairs. He is
          interested in to visit the wedding in the hopes of income and the party could be a good escort
          there.

          <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Toiva" type="monster" /> A shy human male who inherited the inn
          from relatives. He takes care of the inn alone. He doesn't speak unnecessarily and is really bad at
          small talk. Not the ideal innkeeper, but you do with what has been given to you. His wife Ano is
          sick with a disease of the mind which turned her into unresponsive state a year ago. Toiva doesn't
          have enough time to keep the inn running, treat her wife and look after their ten year old son
          Ilmari who roams the woods freely. He is not into innkeeping but more of an explorer. They live in a
          separate building next to the inn. If asked about rumors, he doesn't mention his wife but others in
          the inn can tell about this "public secret". Toiva doesn't speak much his life and uses short
          sentences. Just answer quickly and shortly and aim for awkward silences! A DC 10 Insight check tells
          the party that Toiva has something to hide. Toiva saw Rautia drinking with the bandits and has heard
          stories of bandit activity in north, on the road near Ukko's fist (Ukonnyrkki) settlement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Ilmari" type="monster" /> The son of Toiva and Ano. A bright 12
          year old boy with a curious mind and a lot of time in his hands. He spends the time exploring nearby
          areas. He arrives to the inn when the party is there the first time to tell his father that he is
          afraid of the rats he was told to get rid of in their house basement. "But there are so many of
          them!" The party can take the task of getting rid of the rats. Ilmari can also tell the party about
          Körri, family's cat who has been missing for weeks. If the party gets rid of the rats, Toiva will
          pay them 10gp and provide a free room for one night. Ilmari tells that he will go see "the grandpa"
          and runs away.
        </p>
        <sub-area-title name="Toiva's House" />
        <p>
          The simple house of Toiva, Ano and Ilmari has two large rooms and a cellar. It is a log house with
          simple wooden furniture. Dried food has been stored to the first room and it also has a fireplace.
          Second room two beds, where in the larger one lies a woman, Ano. The only sign of consciousness are
          the open eyes and occasional swallowing. This disease cannot be cured. In the cellar the party finds
          huge amount of rats, i.e.
          <encounter

              { name: 'Swarm of Rats', quantity: 10 },

            ]"
          />
          The rats are Körri's little "army" he has been recruiting to take over the village house by house.
          Körri hisses and the rats turn around and attack immediately. Körri has sold his soul to a cat demon
          to get the command over his little minions. You can play this out a bit with Körri's behaviour but
          this is just a weird side quest. Don't expect it to continue.

        have camped close to the road. One of them is keeping watch nearby close to the road, others are
        maintaining their gear but have put Rautia to do the blacksmithing. Their plan is to take Rautia with
        them, but he doesn't actually mind. He is enjoying the perks of his new environment, contents of a
        captured beer delivery, and has decided to leave Bluebill's Nest to seek easier life of a drunk. He
        doesn't fight of fear. If the party kills the bandits, Rautia is miserable due to the lost
        opportunity. He needs something stronger than beer and tells that he is heading towards Ukonnyrkki
        settlement which is nearby. A chest in the camp contains 50gp.
        <section-title name="Wedding" />
        <area-title name="Halla Farm" />
        This is a large farm south of Sotkala, next to a huge marshland Hallasuo. The marshland has been owned
        by Halla family for centuries but marsh doesn't much so the land is worthless. Also the air in the
        marshes cools down significantly during the nights making the environment even harsher for plants. Not
        many dare to venture there as tales tell that people go mad and drown themselves into swamp pools.
        People got lost and their clothes were found from the marshes. It is rumored that evil creatures
        inhabit the area nowadays. Tapio Halla or other family members can tell about these tales and rumours.
        <read-aloud>
          You arrive to a farmstead and see a lot of people sitting around a long table. All of them are
          wearing exceptionally clean and formal clothes and the place has been decorated with birch branches
          and flowers. This is a wedding of the man at the end of the long table, Antero Halla and his fiancee
          Vilja Halla. The man at the end of the table rises and the crowd goes silent. The man holds a tin
          bucket high and starts to sing: "Mehtolan metinen muori, Metän kultanen kuningas, Tule nyt häihin
          härköisiis, Pitkän villaisi pitoihin." He starts walking and others rise up and follow. Soon they
          form a line and move behind the lead singer.

        If the party follows:
        <read-aloud>
          The crowd walks silently across the road and climbs all the way to top of a nearby hill. There the
          leader stops at a large gray ash tree. The tree is lush but barely the party sees some ornaments on
          its branches. The man lays down the container. He puts his hands inside and brings up a freshly
          cleaned bear skull, still dripping last drops of blood. He sings again: "En pistä sua pihlajaan,
          Enkä raitaan rakenna, Vaan honkaan hyvään puuhun, johon tuuli käypi pohjoisesta ja etelästä ja
          kaikilta tuulilta." Suddenly Kylli opens her mouth and sings with the same melody: "Tule, poikani
          polonen, Tuolla on ollut suuren suon sivulla, Ei oo tulta ei tulusta, Vara saaha valkijata" The man
          walks up to the tree and ties the fresh skull on the trunk. Suddenly the party realize that the
          ornaments are older skulls. Silently the crowd turns back and starts walking back to the farm.
        </read-aloud>
        At the farm the crowd returns to celebration. Here the party can find the Halla family, father Tapio,
        mother Vilja, and three girls Kylli, Lempo, and Mielo. Tapio or Vilja can explain that the ritual
        returns the bear back to its mother who will send it back on earth to be hunted again. They can also
        tell about the marshes and the ownership but they don't speak about the tales and rumours eagerly.
        They will if they are asked or if one of their children happens to mention about them. They have been
        wondering why Tapio's brother's family didn't arrive to the bear celebration (karhunpeijaiset). Their
        farm is on the south east side of the marshes. They cannot leave their kids right now so they request
        the party to investigate and promise to pay 20g.
        <section-title name="Forgotten Marshes" />
        <sub-area-title name="Halla Farm -> Hallaneva Farm" />
        To east leads a little traversed path. It goes through grassy lands and sparse woods. To north the
        party sees denser forests with no visible paths. After few kilometers they meet a stranger, a tough
        looking dwarf woman next to a wagon, which leans heavily on its side. The woman
        <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Jutikka Äyräs" type="monster" />, a merchant, sits against its
        side and examines a broken wagon wheel in her hands. She is seemingly tired as she doesn't notice the
        party at first. She explains that her wagon wheel fell off the path and broke with the wagon axle. She
        was going to Hallasuo encampment to trade fur and silver. Her mercenary guards left to get help back
        to the farm west yesterday morning but she hasn't seen them since. They should have arrived already.
        She proposes that the party helps her carry what they can to Hallasuo encampment, which she explains
        is a trader outpost on a shortcut through the marshes. From there she can get more help. She promises
        to pay 20gp each. In reality she wants to lure them into a trap, the same one she lured the Halla
        brother Jurva and his son Osmo. Luckily their mother and sick daughter stayed home. DC 15 insight
        check allows the party to sense that something fishy is going on. DC 15 intimidation check will make
        her reveal what she knows about the trap and the operation.
        <sub-area-title name="Hallasuo encampment" />
        The party can try to fix the wagon they will need Carpenter's Tools and a DC 18 check. If they
        succeed, the woman will request them to escort her with even higher fee. If the party helps to escort
        the lady, she leads them to a hidden path covered with branches and takes them into the forest. After
        some walking, a hemp net is dropped from trees high above and the party is ambushed. DC 15 Wisdom
        saving throw allows them to notice the net. DC 10 Acrobatics saving throw to get out of the way.
        Characters tangled in the net become Restrained and need DC 10 Athletics check if they want to start
        moving.

        <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Kobold', quantity: 8 }]" /> emerge from the forest and try to swarm the
        party. The dwarf woman curses of the inefficacy and escapes through the forest into the marshes. If
        the party searches, they find a trail to a kobold camp outpost. From the outpost another path leads to
        the marshes and soon to the camp which is currently empty but contains a chest with 10g in a lean to
        shelter covered with moss. The chest has a trap that strikes out sharp stick and requires a DC 10
        Perception check to notice if searching for traps. Otherwise a DC 15 Acrobatics check to dodge the
        trap. The trap affects only the person opening the chest with 1d6+2 damage. When the chest is opened
        and the trap goes off two Kobolds attack. If the trap is disarmed or doesn't hit, the kobolds run and
        can be pursued. The chest contains five letters. The earliest dated letter describes the plot that the
        party just became a victim of and orders to deliver the captured "searchers" to the main camp. Later
        letters order to keep "the operation" ongoing and keep on delivering "searchers". One of the letters
        has a broken black seal with some kind of wings on it. It is hard to see properly. The dates of
        letters span for a period of half a year. The dates just aren't the same as what the party has
        experienced before. According to them, it is now year 470. At their own plane, the year is 1356.
        <comment title="What kobolds and Jutikka know?">
          DC 15 Intimidation check is enough that either tells about the search operation in the marshes. A
          secret group has hired kobolds to search for some kind structure or artifact at the marshes. They
          don't really know what they a searching but they were instructed "you will know when you find it".
          To hasten the search they have captured people to work for them. Jurva and Osmo Halla have been
          taken to the labor camp in the middle of the marsh.
        </comment>
        <sub-area-title name="Hallasuo Base Camp" />
        Another path leads from the camp deeper into the marsh. The further the party travels, the denser the
        air gets with the smell of rotting vegetation and vision is blocked by dense mist. If Jutikka
        survives, she is found stuck in a marsh pool and calls for help. She promises to tell what she knows
        about the Hallas. The party may use her to get into the dungeon without a fight. After walking blindly
        just staring at their feet, they arrive to a small plank bridge which crosses a ditch full of water
        and soon after the terrain turns drier. The mist is not as severe here. Soon they see fires ahead and
        hear talking in Draconic. It is a camp of three large tents which surround a low dark structure. Group
        of <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Kobold', quantity: 20 }]" /> are cooking and resting by the fire and
        can be surprised. They will attack if they notice the party. Looting the kobolds yields 20gp. The
        structure in the middle of the camp is a rectangle shaped platform made of stone blocks. On the fire
        side, there are stairs leading down underground. It is possible to sneak in past the kobolds with a DC
        15 stealth check.
        <area-title name="Monastery of Ukko" />
        <sub-area-title name="Entry Hall" />
        The party descends down torch lit stairs into a hall with two lines of pillars. In the end of the hall
        is a wall size symbol of Ukko called Ukonvasara (Hammer of Ukko) made of iron and covered in rust. The
        place is clearly hundreds of years old.<encounter
          :enemies="[{ name: 'Metsäläinen Soldier', quantity: 2 }]"
        />
        guard the hall in the middle of it and are commanded to let none pass unless accompanied with a high
        ranking leader. The soldiers are clad in simple leather cloths. Kobolds are not allowed down in the
        monastery (except for scouting dangerous areas). The soldiers will attack and one tries to run to warn
        others in the bed chamber. If the soldiers are examined closely the party finds a small bird foot sown
        to their shirts, right above heart. On the sides are five doorways on each side. Two first on the
        right have collapsed and cannot be accessed. Next two have closed doors but the last one is open. On
        the left first two have been barred shut with heavy latches. If the party makes noise, they can hear
        something moving behind the first door. Behind are
        <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Black Pudding', quantity: 2 }]" /> which attack if the door is opened.
        If the second door is opened, the party finds a room full of dry flying insect corpses and a nest at
        the back wall. Third and fourth doors are sealed with a magical seal that can be opened with Knock.
        Inside is a unfortunate kobold corpse that got trapped in when the monastery was discovered. Behind
        the last door is a badly burned corpse and the door has also mostly burned away. The party should
        finally continue through the last door on the right.

        Perception check finds a lever behind a bookshelf that opens the secret door, but if the roll is below
        15 PC misses the more worn lever that also disables the arrow trap inside. Two arrows fly out of the
        room and PC has to succeed DC 10 Acrobatics check to avoid them. Inside the chest is one Potion of
        Greate Healing, Scroll of Unseen Servant, and a garnet.

        Rain Hall is a high hall with 6 pillars in two rows. The ceiling is sphere shaped and 60ft tall. In
        the middle of the ceiling is a stalactite like smooth pole which descends down for 20 feet. The
        ceiling is full of small holes that shine faint light and drizzle down water. Down on the floor the
        water drops create a rain like effect. At the end of the hall is a large round pool with live
        vegetation around it, some stunted shrubs and grass that has only faintly green color. Otherwise the
        hall floor has only rubble where the ceiling has lost its strength during the centuries. With closer
        inspection and added lighting it can be seen that the paintings cover the walls of the hall. The
        ceiling is depiction of the night sky but the walls are still so dirty that the images cannot be
        inspected. At the pool sits metsäläinen <id-link name="Ahto Piki" type="monster" /> examining the
        vegetation. Two slaves are cleaning the pillars at the same end of the hall. One of them is Osmo
        Halla, Tapio Halla's nephew and Jurva Halla's son. The slaves may warn the Cult Fanatic or help the
        party in the fight or not, I let you decide. Ahto Piki has 100gp, and an order letter from their
        leader which has the same black seal as seen in previous letters. Now it can be seen that the bird in

          Letter says: Finally some true progress! Patience was again key to success just as we anticipated.
          Finding the monastery may give us the answers we need but the small amount of documents is indeed
          disheartening. It seems the ancestors were clever enough to try taking their secrets into their

        After the fight, Osmo Halla reveals that his father was commanded to the marshes to show the abductors
        some other possibly interesting location in exchange for his son's freedom. He left his son behind
        because the journey is dangerous. Osmo has been cleaning the paintings for two days and hasn't
        eavesdropped anything significant. Osmo also knows the location his father spoke of. It is another

        The party should follow Osmo to Hallasuo Cache, which is a secret storage that Ukko worshippers left
        behind. There they will find 15 kobolds carrying supplies and tools, Jurva Halla and a tall elder
        bearded human male with black robes and a bird claw on his shirt. He is
        <id-link name="Joukahainen" type="monster" /> but let's keep that as a secret for now. The area around
        the structure is almost dry in a rippling 90ft circle of magic. The man seems to be preparing for
        something and kobolds stand around him anxiously waiting. The man is placing various objects on the
        ground but the party can't see them well. Jurva Halla stays still a numb look on his face, with eyes
        like glass. The party most likely waits to see what happens. After a few minutes the man starts to
        speak:
        <read-aloud>
          Säkei'en säilö, sammio salain saarretun, salas saranoi narauta, laverra lukkoi lorun, vaivoin

        </read-aloud>
        The party hears a faint rumble which starts to grow. First thin cracks form on the structure's surface
        and then pieces of stone blocks start to fall off to ground. At times block pieces jump back on their
        places forced by a counter-acting spell, but the man's power seems to be too much. The structure is
        near collapsing when one of its walls breaks outwards with great force and two kobolds get crushed to
        death by flying stone blocks. A
        <id-link name="Golem Guardian" type="monster" /> shrieks and steps out attacking nearby kobolds
        crushing two with just one swing. The man stops channeling the spell surprised. Simultaneously Jurmo
        Halla seems to gain his wits and looks around confused and in increasing horror. The golem continues
        to ravage the kobolds while the man sneaks inside the structure. Soon he comes out with a brown sack
        in his hand, takes a look at the party one last time and vanishes into air. The main thing here is to
        describe Golem Guardian's immense power clearly. The party should ideally get Jurmo, Osmo and
        themselves to safety because the golem will likely be too much for the party. Jurmo and/or Osmo may
        die here, your call. After the event, Jurmo or Osmo cannot tell much about the abductors other than
        they were searching for some ancient information. Osmo finally remembers that one of the cultists
        called them as metsäläiset. They know the marshes well so that is why they knew the location of the
        cache, although they had no idea of its purpose. They didn't know about the monastery as it was
        completely submerged. They propose that they continue to their farm in the south-east corner of
        Hallasuo to rest.
        <area-title name="Hallaneva Farm" />
        Here are Jurmo Halla's wife Mielitty and sick daughter Liekko. They will tell that Jurmo and Osmo left
        to the wedding but haven't returned yet. If the party arrives with the men, the wife is shocked of
        their condition and Jurmo will explain the situation. The daughter lies sick in bed with Horkka
        disease, commonly believed to be caused by similarly named Demon. Horkka causes high fever and
        convulsions and can be deadly for children and elder. If the party cures the child's disease, Jurmo
        happily requests to pray for Tellervo, the daughter of god Tapio, to bless the party. He leads them
        through a dense patch of forest to a Tapio's table, which is a short juniper tree which has grown
        horizontally to a table like form. He speaks a spell:
        <read-aloud>
          Honkien haltija, korpikantoin kaihtija, Tyttäres Tellervoinen, impi iän ikuinen, taivu ainoinen
          Tapio, päästä neito pöytähän, hopiat luovun halustani, pöydän korean kannelle.
        </read-aloud>
        During the last verse, he carves few slices of silver onto the table. He leaves and beckons the party
        to follow. Back at the farm he thanks the party again and wishes them Tapio's and Tellervo's guidance.
        He also requests the party to take his congratulations to Halla farm and to explain the situation. The
        party does not feel any different. DC 10 religion check can be done to remember mention of an ancient
        foreign god of forest, Tapio. The party has now received Tellervo's blessing and they will find an
        item leaning against a tree during their trip back to Halla Farm and 20pp.

        <area-title name="The Gray Keep" />
        A great keep on the shore of western Pohjola. It is built on barren rocky land that continues all the
        way to the border of the north along the sea. This area has very little life but the sea offers plenty
        of fish, crabs, and mussels. Terrain is rocky and barren and deep crevasses divide the shore to long
        platforms that reach to the sea. The keep was built by metsäläiset but after they were banished,
        kalevan fishermen made it their home. Catch was great so little by little they kept on spreading and
        extending their fortress. The keep is crudely built stony building but sometimes receives prestigious
        residents, although often royally disliked characters.
        <id-link name="Kaino Kalpa" type="monster" /> spent five years there managing the keep but leaving
        most of the accounting and decision making to his advisors. Sometimes he preferred to make arbitrary
        decisions about things he knew nothing about, just to feel himself important and needed. He has now
        left the keep to the relief of locals.

        deliveries towards the inner land. He is a meticulous man who loves numbers, tables, and accounting in
        general. He just doesn't understand why his fishermen keep going missing. Five boats have disappeared
        during four weeks and the scouts haven't found a sign of the boats. They have mostly searched further
        away from the shore so he suggests that the party should stay closer to the shoreline, especially if
        they don't have sailing experience. He also recommends talking to
        <id-link id="monster-gray-keep-militia" name="Commander Pulkkinen" type="monster" /> as he is
        investigating another issue. The boats have been sunk by a
        <id-link name="Saltwater Scrag" type="monster" />. It has anchored some boats to the ocean floor and
        eaten the fishermen and their catch. The party has to take a boat to lure the scrag out of the sea.
        Killing the scrag may reveal its nest on the sea floor that contains a 2 carat diamond and the Cap of

        officer turned ex-fisherman Pulkkinen is a burly dwarf male with rugged worker hands and a face
        oldened by sea weather. He is not the most traditional commander but so isn't Gray Keep militia
        either. All have some kind of background in fishing so they understand Pulkkinen's peculiar commands,
        like "Sharpen your hooks!" to do equipment maintenance. He should also use all kinds of fishing
        expressions in his speech: "Have a reely good day.", "Seems a bit fishy to me.", "You've been
        schooled.". Pulkkinen tells the party that someone has been stealing their catch from "the tank". He
        explains that the tank is a large artificial pond they have created to keep the fish alive and fresh
        until they are sold to merchants. He suggests that the party investigates the tank. The issue was
        noticed yesterday when they conducted the first inspection of the tank in a long time. Earlier Kaino
        Kalpa had taken the solid responsibility of it without really doing his job. Pulkkinen doesn't trust
        Kaino and always suspected that there was something fishy about him. He spent most of his time
        dreaming about becoming the half-king. Kaino allowed metsäläiset to install the portal to the bottom
        for a promise that the would become the half-king one day.
        <sub-area-title name="The Tank" />
        A half ball shaped pond carved into the rocky shore. It is covered with a leathery cover that keeps
        the birds and other animals away. There are lids that can be opened to look inside. Hand nets with
        long shafts lie next to the lids. A member of
        <id-link name="Gray Keep Militia" type="monster" /> circles around the pond. The guard claims they
        have seen nothing unusual except the amount of fish has been reducing. On the bottom of the tank is a
        2ft wide portal that leads to a cave river in a cave at the north end of the shoreline. The fish are
        able to escape through it. If the party dives and goes through the portal they find themselves in an
        underground river and start to drift with the current. Only DC 18 athletics check allows a party
        member to swim back to the portal. The river takes them through a dark tunnel into an underground
        lake. Closer to the bank, on the other side of the lake, party sees a
        <id-link name="Northern Giant" type="monster" /> standing waist deep in water. It swings a large net,
        catching fish and emptying the catch into a cart. When the cart is full, the giant pushes it out of
        the cave to the next chamber. It has to crawl on its knees to fit through the exit tunnel.

        From the underground lake a tunnel leads to a large chamber with six
        <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="metsäläinens" type="monster" /> cleaning and salting fish. Fish
        are finally packed to wagons that are dragged away. In addition, there is a man in wooden hand carved

        <section-title name="The Mad Chief" />
        <area-title name="Ukko's Fist (Ukonnyrkki) settlement" />
        Ukko's Fist is a settlement north of Bluebill's Nest. A small castle and few tens of log houses are
        surrounded by a crude wooden wall. Fields surround the keep and most of the citizens have housing in
        the safety of settlement walls. Majority of the citizens are farmers but few crafts, like weaving and
        woodcrafting are also practiced. Farming of barley is however the main source of income. Ukko's Fist
        is led by
        <id-link name="Chief Ikäheimo" type="monster" />, who has ruled the settlement well in the past.
        During the last months his actions have seemed unpredictable. He has increased the amount of combat
        training of citizens significantly so they have very little time after farming and training duties. He
        also started selling majority of their produced barley to a forestry group and rumours tell that the
        price was lower than what the Sword cities were paying. He is being mind controlled by Joukahainen
        with a gem on his golden ring which he fiddles with when he is being forced to a decision. He received
        the ring as an anonymous gift.
        <sub-area-title name="Keep" />
        The keep in the center of the settlement is the home of Chief Ikäheimo and his wife
        <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Tarjanne" type="monster" />. The keep has two floors above the
        ground and a dungeon floor for prisoners. On the ground floor there are the main hall, kitchen, arms
        storage and two smaller bedrooms for guests or house staff. On the top floor, there are the main bed
        room, a reading room and two more bed rooms for house staff. In the dungeon are few cells with just
        one prisoner witch Autere. <id-link name="Witch Autere" type="monster" /> She is an old black haired
        elf lady who lived in Ukko's Fist. She was publicly accepted healer whose "experiments" with old
        magics got the blind eye of the village. However, a half a year ago she was thrown into jail for
        "crossing the line" but the reason wasn't publicly announced. In her words, she didn't do anything,
        which is true. Chief Ikäheimo threw her into jail because she would have noticed the mind controlling
        ring. She knows about old magic and is able to tell the party about their situation after they help
        free her. She has had enough of helping other people for nothing. After she is freed, she will tell
        that they have used an old spell that transferred the party to another plane. Usually there would have
        been another person that ends the spell in their own plane. There might be another way but she doesn't
        know it. The royal archives in the Sword cities could contain the answer. If the party requests her to
        inspect Chief Ikäheimo for a disease one last time, she complies. They just have to figure out how to
        do that with the wife. If they succeed, Autere realizes the ring's significance and tells the party to
        destroy it. After all of this, Autere leaves the town. For curing the chief, chief gives them a 1
        carat Diamond as a reward.
        <id-link name="Chief Ikäheimo" type="monster" />
        A strong middle-aged dwarf male who is the son of late smith Ikäheimo. Rose to chiefdom through his
        skill of inspiring and natural charm by a public vote. Has become overconfident over the years and
        easily irritable after he received the ring. The ring works with a bit of delay, so he may start
        answering truthfully, but then switch to a lie. After this he fiddles his ring. Has a task for the
        party which requires them to fetch a travelling seer and throw him into his dungeon. He claims that
        the seer is actually a known necromancer who is suspected of Armas Eteläterä's murder. Truly, he has
        just been working as a fortuneteller and may be able to identify the ring. He can be found in the
        local inn. The reward will be 10gp each and his trust. The party is able to notice his fiddling with a
        DC 18 Perception check. When they face more an more lies, the check should become easier. The check
        can be tried again each time they meet him. If they decide to fight him, few guards join in to defend
        their chief.

        <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Tarjanne" type="monster" /> Wife of Chief Ikäheimo. Calm and
        rational dwarf lady who has been worried about her husband because he hasn't been the same for a
        while. She suspects sickness and asks the party to heal her husband. She would have asked Autere but
        she is in the dungeon. <id-link id="monster-soldier-of-the-sword" name="Dog" type="monster" /> The
        dungeon guard Dog is a thoughtful dwarf male. Not very strong, so he isn't the best soldier but
        guarding cells doesn't usually require much physically and he likes the solidarity. He has been
        thinking about why the witch has been jailed because she seemed like a good person. She even healed
        his syphilis (huovintauti). Dog can be assured of his theory by finding some information to back it up
        and with DC 10 persuasion check. They can also lie about the information. They just need the
        credibility for that, so bringing the seer to the dungeon works fine. If successful, he will let the
        party to fake an intrusion somehow. Another way to enter the dungeon is through a chimney that goes
        through the whole keep. On upper floors, it can be accessed through kitchen or the main bed room.
        Finding the vent requires a DC 15 Perception check in one of the rooms when searching for a way into
        the dungeon.
        <sub-area-title name="Heaven's Inn (Taivain Majatalo)" />
        A small inn next to the settlement entrance. The seer has a room upstairs. There are five men sharing
        a table downstairs. The innkeeper is not around. When the party goes upstairs there are four doors of
        which one is open. When they approach any of the doors, they hear a voice from the open room: "Come
        in.".
        <id-link name="Seer Kaukovalta" type="monster" /> is an old male human with bald head and a long fake
        beard. It can be noticed with DC 10 perception check. The beard is just for the looks, it, in his
        words, is more convincing in seer work than his completely bald face. He has been hairless since born.
        He sits on his bed and demands to know why they have come to get him, although calmly. He is an actual
        seer, but can't see very far into the future. His visions are usually hard to interpret. When the
        party talks with him, the five men from downstairs walk behind them calmly with hands on their wooden
        clubs. Seer hired the men to cover for him and told the innkeeper to hide. The party can fight the
        <encounter
          :enemies="[
            { name: 'Thug', quantity: 5 },

        />
        and capture the seer or convince him to join a plot to infiltrate the dungeon. Seer will be reluctant
        to join the plot. He sees a reward in his future but he suspects that he could get it also from his
        regular customers. After the encounter, the innkeeper raises his head above the counter. If asked
        about rumours, he tells that
        <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Leino" type="monster" /> has been missing for days after he went
        bear hunting. His dog Myy ran back one day ago and arrived to the inn. The dog is behind the inn. The
        dog can be captured and leashed with DC 10 animal handling check. If the dog escapes they can try to
        run after it with a DC 10 athletics check. The dog returns to the inn after a while and then the party
        may try again. A piece of meat makes the check succeed every time.
        <section-title name="Down Below" />
        The dog can take them into the woods where they find a bloody site. Closer inspection shows dragging
        marks and blood stains on the foliage. They continue into a hole under a trunk of a fallen tree. They
        can crawl after him into a dark tunnel that fits only one man at a time. The tunnel takes them into a
        low room where only small characters can stand straight. Others suffer -1 for all combat rolls (not
        damage) due to awkward positions during their time there. The place is completely dark.
        <area-title name="Underdark (Maanalanen)" />
        These tunnels need to be describe as vast and completely dark but only some of them are made

        <id-link name="Deep Gnome" type="monster" /> from <id-link name="Guard Chamber" type="subarea" /> will
        come investigate.

        An underground river goes through this room and can take the party next to
        <id-link name="Living Chamber" type="subarea" />. There is one Deep Gnome, which will notice
        characters that are not able to resist the flow. Resisting the river flow requires passing a DC 10
        athletics check. Failed characters arrive to the new chamber prone.

        a large room full of bunks. A small hole in the wall allows the loggers to get their rations from the
        kitchen. One human male is handling the cooking by stirring a large pot of stew. There may be plenty
        of logger Commoners around depending the time of day. There is also another log house for the camp
        officer. Two guards stand outside and the officer is inside keeping accounts and calculating
        paychecks. He has a bird's feet on his shirt. The officer,
        <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Kauko" type="monster" />, is quite unpleasantly blunt man and
        cannot be intimidated easily. He lies that they know nothing about the bridge collapse but suspects
        the rebels of the refugee camp up river of framing them. Workers may be more easily intimidated but
        there may be a large number of them, so things may turn ugly! The workers can admit that they did it
        but they were just commanded to do so. If the officer is intimated to speak, he tells that the point
        is to accelerate the restlessness in Pohjola. He receives his commands in letters carried by birds but
        isn't sure who is sending them.
        <area-title name="Ambushed by metsäläiset" />
        An ambush that is supposed to happen after the party has disrupted metsäläiset for the first time, or
        the second time, your call. Metsäläiset want to know who they are dealing with so they try to
        interrogate at least one member of the party.
        <encounter

        are hiding next to the road. When the party arrives the Druid starts to speak and the dogs start to
        circle around the party. He requests to know who the party members are and asks why they interfered
        with the operation at the marshes. A fight may ensue.
        <area-title name="Refugee Camp" />
        <p>
          Refugees of the Sword cities have built a camp to the south side of Fuller river. They have their
          own village of shacks and some have even built small log cabins. More refugees are coming in
          constantly and there is shortage of food. There is also a problem with northern barbarians regularly
          attacking the camp. The refugees can tell about the political turmoil and the spoilt river water.
          They all have their own beliefs of the causes behind the issues. They have heard about the collapsed
          bridge and are worried about their supply delivery. Most of the people around seem starved and
          desperate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Refugee leader tells that the barbarians have a safe place up north in an old ruin. They must have
          food stored there since they have been robbing a lot lately. Refugee camp leader
          <id-link id="monster-soldier-of-the-sword" name="Kyösti" type="monster" /> tries to assure the party
          that they had nothing to do with the bridge collapse. He requests the party to take care of the
          barbarians. They have nothing to offer as reward in addition to a warm meal but they suspect that
          the ancient barbarian stronghold may hold valuables treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also rumours of a ghost in the camp. A small ghost of a
          <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Myling', quantity: 1 }]" /> has reportedly appeared two times at
          night. It cries and tries to attack people. Kyösti thinks people are hallucinating because of
          hunger. If the party kills the ghost, it will vanish and reappear the next night. A desperate
          refugee woman killed her newborn child, because she wasn't able to nourish him, and buried him under
          their shack due to shame. The child's soul has been trapped into this plane and can be freed only
          with proper burial, i.e. a Myling (Ihtiriekko). The woman committed suicide afterwards which caused
          a great shock in the camp. She had told others that she sent the child away with the father. In
          truth, the father hasn't been involved in a long time and has left the camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the party resolves the case, Kyösti writes them a letter to be delivered to the court of
          Eteläterä. A reward waits for the party there. The letter is sealed with a purple seal of a
          horizontal sword with the top half removed. If read, It contains intelligence information of the
          area. This isn't just a refugee camp after all but an intelligence unit has been hidden here. The
          letter writes that they suspect the loggers of sabotage at the bridge. They also suspect that
          someone is working with metsäläiset at the Sword. They propose an intelligence mission to
          metsäläiset capital Kuurankaru. Kyösti proposes that the party takes care of the barbarians before
          leaving to the Sword. If the party does so, Kyösti confesses his part in Eteläterä's intelligence
          operation and asks if the party found anything about metsäläiset, he includes the information to the
          letter and hands it over to the party.

        <section-title name="Temple of Päivätär" />
        <area-title name="Holy of The Valley (Alangon Pyhä)" />
        <p>
          This is an ancient temple that is used by northern barbarians as a shelter. The temple is located in
          the middle of a valley between two fjelds but on the ground there is only a stone platform and
          stairs down into the temple. Barbarians have set up a leather tent on top of it to hide it and cover
          it from the elements. Inside, they have ripped down all ancient symbols and replaced them with their
          own, crude wall paintings of animals, animal skulls and spruce branches. In the tent are also some
          of the food they have stolen or hunted, mainly meat in a sled. The party can just steal the sled or
          delve into the temple. There are no barbarians around except
          <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Barbarian', quantity: 3 }]" /> guards on top. When the party comes
          back up from the temple they will face a barbarian raiding party of 40 barbarians and are forced to
          escape into the temple.
        </p>
        <sub-area-title name="The Entrance Top" />
        A leather tent that conceals a sled full of meat and dairy products and a stone platform that has a
        heavy iron double door that can be locked from inside. Few guards are guarding. When the group returns
        from the temple they notice a raid party of 40 barbarians close by riding towards them. Escaping is
        hard so they are forced to fight or escape into the temple.
        <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Barbarian', quantity: 40 }]" />
        <sub-area-title name="Entry Hall" />
        <p>
          A stone stairway takes the party into a 60ft wide and 100ft long hall filled with animal hides,
          straw beds and food storage. Another large iron door separates the stairs from this hall but it is
          open now. It can also be locked with a latch. Not that many weapons around because the barbarians
          are out raiding. No-one is in sight. A thorough search of the hall reveals a letter that orders the
          barbarians to keep on raiding. "Continue as planned. We will honour the contract". The letter is
          sealed with the same black eagle as the letters before. The party also finds a blue painting of a
          woman's face behind the layer of grime on the back wall. Seeing the lady brings a sentence into the
          party member's minds:
          <read-aloud>
            I am an eye set in a blue face. My gaze feeds the world. If I go blind so does the world. (Silmä
            kasvoin sinisten, ravitsija maailmankaiken, näköni jos veisi, veisi näön maan, sokeaksi kaiken
            tekisi.)
          </read-aloud>
          This is a riddle and the correct answer is the sun. Even thinking of the correct answer with any
          language causes a secret door to open and reveal another hall.
        </p>
        <sub-area-title name="Päivätär Shrine" />
        <p>
          This hall is slightly smaller than the first one. A grand statue of the sun, although dusty, stands
          at the back of it, and a red carpet leads to it. A ray of light shines through the ceiling at it. It
          comes from a magical one-way window that works also as an escape hatch.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dark figure lays in front of it covered in dust. It is hard to see what it is. When the party
          enters the room the figure starts to move. It is a
          <id-link name="Young Gold Dragon" type="monster" /> that has been hibernating under a spell and
          commanded to guard the temple. It shakes off the dust and reveals the golden scales in all their
          glory. It queries the party of their purpose with a low voice. If the party is meaning good, the
          dragon can explain that this is Päivätär's shrine and he is commanded to guard it until the sun is
          eaten and all hope is lost. The dragon can be convinced to help kill the barbarians or fly the party
          up to the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          Päivätär is the goddess of day and sun, a beautiful lady who "owns the gold of the sun" just like
          Kuutar, the goddess of the moon, owns "the silver of the moon". Unfortunately, there is not much
          more information of these goddesses in Finnish folk lore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Praying at the shrine and gifting the goddess a decent amount of gp will yield a magical item. E.g.
          giving min. 10gp with a decent prayer will give some potion, e.g. Potion of Healing (Greater), min.
          50gp yields some magical item e.g. Lantern of Revealing. Min. 200gp yields an uncommon weapon and
          min. 500gp a rare armor. These limits are not set in stone so you should consider the PC's
          sacrifice. One item per PC! Extra prayers give nothing and won't take the money either! If the party
          don't know how to pray maybe the dragon can give them a hint to offer some "gold of the sun" to the
          goddess.

          Twin settlements of the Sword, the North Edge and the South Edge, are the most prosperous
          settlements in Pohjola, or at least they once were. Untamo Eteläterä's heir Armas Eteläterä died by
          falling from a castle tower and everybody blames the court of Pohjanterä, the previously friendly
          rival settlement. Then the river water turned gray and started causing sickness to the elderly and
          children. Everyone in Pohjanterä court blamed Eteläterä for a horrifying petty revenge for a crime
          they didn't do. Pohjanterä court believes Eteläterä has a secret reserve or a source of water. This
          has caused unprecedented tension in the Sword and scuffles at the border posts are common. More and
          more people flee the settlements looking for a more peaceful place to live and, more importantly,
          for food. There is shortage of water and food. Crime is nowadays common as desperation drives people
          to desperate actions. The last "full" king, Kaukovalta of the Sword (Miekan Kaukovalta), ordered to
          split the kingdom two generations ago before the current rulers. He was afraid of the power he had
          and decided to split it into two. A new title half-king was given to his son and his brother's son.
          Until today the half-kings ruled without wars and other major conflicts.
        </p>
        <section-title name="Southern Hospitality" />
        <area-title name="Twin Settlement of South Edge" />
        <p>
          A castle at the coast of the North Sea (Pohjanmeri) ruled by half-king Untamo Eteläterä. The kingdom
          consists of all the land south of Fuller river excluding the independent state Buckler. The land is
          more fertile than the north, but large portion of it is marshland.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link name="Untamo Eteläterä" type="monster" /> The king of South Edge. He is a very old human
          male, but he still has his wit. He just can't understand why would Kekko Pohjanterä, the half-king
          of Pohjanterä, kill his son. He hasn't ruled out the possibility of suicide, even though that seems
          even more unlikely. There was no trace of an intruder and the castle is well guarded. He is also
          puzzled of the river's condition and has arranged water deliveries from further away. The river
          water just turns foul at one point upriver. Investigating is hard because the current is so strong
          in that part of the river. He has also sent an intelligence unit to the large refugee on the bank of
          river Fuller, which observers the situation there. Their latest mission is also to investigate the
          collapsing of the Gray Bridge (Harmaasilta).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Armas Eteläterä</em> The late heir of South Edge Kingdom. Was pushed down from castle tower but
          the murder has not been resolved. He was still unmarried even though being middle aged. He was still
          in love with Hellä Pohjanterä but for Hellä their relationship wasn't that important. He avoided
          marriage and hoped that he would win Hellä's heart back. When the party arrives, they are taken into
          the castle lobby to wait for the half-king. After they have had some time to discuss and prepare,
          the butler opens <id-link name="Throne Room" type="subarea" /> door and invites them in.
        </p>
        <sub-area-title name="Throne Room" />
        <p>
          The main working room of the half-king. Has purple carpets and curtains, large windows and a stone
          throne with the bottom half of split Kingsblade on top of it. Untamo will receive the intelligence
          from the party with great eagerness and pays 100gp each as a reward. He also requests the party to
          investigate his son's death and the poisoned river. He allows the party to visit his son's room up
          in the tower. The place has not been touched after the initial investigation. The castle guard
          hasn't had many suspects but one of them is Veli Hopea, an adventurer who was loudly criticizing the
          king in a local Inn. He escaped soon after guards tried to apprehend him. Another suspect was the
          cleaner, gnome male Osma, who was the last to enter prince's room before his death. They haven't
          been able to get him to confess even after thorough interrogation. He is being held in the castle
          dungeon. The party can also visit him. There is also Kaino Kalpa who has a strong motive to kill
          Armas, but he has been confirmed to been out of town during the death.
        </p>

        <sub-area-title name="Castle Tower" />
        <p>
          Armas' living quarters. A spacey room on top of the tower with windows to all directions. A large
          balcony from which the prince fell down. There are no signs of struggle and everything seems to be
          in neat order. There are many small paintings of people on the wall. DC15 Perception check reveals
          that there is a feint square on the wall where years of sunlight has colored the wall around another
          painting. This was the painting of Hellä Pohjanterä, right above the prince's bed. No one remembers
          who was depicted in the image. However, there is the portrait of the prince in
          <id-link name="Throne Room" type="subarea" /> that includes a small version of the missing painting
          as well. It depicts a red haired woman and then Osma remembers that it is Hellä Pohjanterä. If the
          party asks for an image of the room, Osma or Untamo remember the portrait.

          The bastard son of Untamo Eteläterä the party maybe met already in Bluebill's Nest. He has been very
          active lately refreshing the old relationships with the court and is secretly exited about the
          latest events. He is now the heir due to the bastard-rule since there the king has no other royal
          sons. However, he is quite scared that he could be suspected about the death so he may act a bit
          nervously. If the party met him at Bluebill's Nest, they can be quite sure of his alibi, unless he
          has hired someone to do the deed...

          man with gray mustache and bald head. He is overly friendly man to others but he is a good friend of
          king Untamo. Untamo discusses about problems of the kingdom with Kalervo but they often enjoy more
          light-hearted conversations e.g. about their youth. He accompanied the king during the death of
          Armas so Untamo is trusting him. He is also the bodyguard of the king and a monk.

          who is now suspected of Armas' death. He is small and skinny gnome that seems exceptionally tidy
          even after spending almost a tenday in dungeon. He is sobbing by himself in a cell that holds also
          two sleeping drunkards. If questioned, Osma eagerly explains how he entered the room earlier that
          evening by opening the door that wasn't locked "What a surprise...". He starts to continue the
          story, but if questioned about the surprise, he explains that the prince always forgot to do that.
          He was quite careless. After entering the room, Osma swiped the floors, changed bed clothes, emptied
          ashes from the fireplace and organized the desk. He didn't notice anything unusual. After that, he
          went to the laundry room to dump the dirty bed clothes and continued to the kitchen to mop the
          floors there. After that he went to his quarters but no one saw him there. He was there at the time
          of the death.

        <sub-area-title name="Royal Archive" />
        A large library full of old books an scrolls. Has also a librarian that the party can ask questions
        from. He is a dwarf male with long beard and robe that has been repaired many times. He does not know
        how to get out from Pohjola. He has heard about a person that came to Pohjola but never left and tried
        to get away, but he can't quite remember the story. "Something about madness... Did he cut off his
        nose? Or was this the candle story? Mumble mumble..." Suggests to try the other archive in North Edge,
        they might have something more.
        <sub-area-title name="Fencer's Inn (Miekkailijain Maja)" />

          The most popular inn of South Edge. Massively long wooden house full of small rooms for renting.
          There is also a large tavern included. Nowadays the inn and the tavern doesn't really have customers
          due to poverty and unsafe streets. The few inn residents mostly stay in their rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Auvo Alku" type="monster" /> The innkeeper in Fencer's Inn.
          Complains about the lack of customers and supplies. There isn't even beer anymore because all the
          pure water goes for drinking. If asked about the death and Veli Hopea, he tells about the events.
          Veli Hopea got very drunk after the night of Armas' death and proclaimed loudly that he would make a
          better half-king than Untamo. He had ideas how to clean the river and went from table to table
          asking people's opinions. This all started when he talked to a man called Heimo Hallava, a local man
          who lives in a large house in the trade district. The innkeeper doesn't know much about him except
          that he is quite... eccentric. He often sits in the tavern and just observes people, drinking hot
          water.
        </p>
        <sub-area-title name="House of Heimo Hallava" />
        <p>
          A glorious house in South Edge trade district. A large double door some exotic wood has an iron
          doorknocker on it. If the party knocks with it, the door opens by itself and the party can enter a
          hallway. After the whole party is in, the main door closes and locks shut. In the other end of the
          hallway is another double door and a lever next to it. Ten red rubies start to glow on top of the
          door. Each second one of them turns dark starting from one side, like a counter. If the party turns
          the lever next to the door, the counter starts again from ten glowing rubies. If the party lets the
          counter to reach zero, the second door opens and they see laughing Heimo standing in front of them.
          "Hahaha, that is always so entertaining. Welcome to my home. May I offer you some snacks?" He offers
          the party cookies and hot water. Heimo is an inventor that spends most of his time with inventing
          and building new gadgets. If questioned about the death, he explains that he may have triggered
          Veli's anger on purpose... Just to amuse himself. "It is a pity what it led to, but I wouldn't
          consider it my fault." If the party is interested in the gadgets, he may offer giving them one to
          try it out in the wild world, but he wants feedback. How was it useful? Did it work correctly? Would
          you use it again? Depending on the feedback, he may consider giving them a reward. Maybe the item
          itself?

      stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds. You can use an action
      to remove the stopper and speak one of three Command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your
      choice) pours out of the flask. The Water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the
      following options: • 'Stream' produces 1 gallon of water. • 'Fountain' produces 5 gallons of water. •
      'Geyser' produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a Bonus
      Action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The
      target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a
      creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The
      object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you."

        <area-title name="Twin Settlement of North Edge" />
        <p>
          A settlement at the coast of the North Sea (Pohjanmeri) ruled by half-king Kekko Pohjanterä. The
          kingdom of North Edge consists of all the land north of Fuller river. The climate is colder than in
          south but the mountains have valuable minerals and gemstones.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link name="Kekko Pohjanterä" type="monster" /> Young and kind human male half-king of the North
          Edge. Thoughtful and sensible man but slightly too gullible. He is being played by his mother Hellä
          Pohjanterä. She has recommended Kekko to start buying wood from metsäläiset and so funding their
          operation in exchange for help when they demand the throne of South Edge. Kekko is really the son of
          Hellä and Armas, the heir of Untamo Eteläterä so he is eligible heir of both thrones. The supposed
          father of Kekko, Neuvo Pohjanterä, had only daughters with Hellä. Kekko believes he is doing the
          right thing and can't see her mother's devious plans. However, he is worried of the state his
          settlement currently is in, and is trying to make peace with the south.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link name="Hellä Pohjanterä" type="monster" /> A cunning middle-aged human female who is using
          her son to achieve her own goals. She had an affair with Armas Eteläterä when they were young. They
          would be both middle-aged now, in case you are wondering... The product of that affair was Kekko,
          the heir of both Sword half-kingdom thrones. Hellä's plan is to unite the two kingdoms to its former
          glory under Kekko's rule, in which Hellä plays a large part. She plays her role as a caring mother
          well but is not afraid to sacrifice people for her own good. She has allied with metsäläiset who
          promised to help her to usurp the power in South Edge when the time comes. She just had to get rid
          of Armas first and then catalyse her own court's anger by poisoning the river water. She didn't
          exactly request poisoning the whole river and not for this whole time, but metsäläiset did what they
          agreed on with the least possible effort. She is not happy about it, but the current situation is
          sufficient for her needs.

        <sub-area-title name="King's Quarters" />
        <p>
          A large room clad in red carpets and curtains. There is a double bed with a decorated wood framing
          and a wood powered heater in the corner. Kekko prefers working here instead of the Throne Room
          without people watching after him. The only people that visit him here regularly are his mother
          Hellä and the half-king's closest advisors. The room has only one visible door but there is a secret
          passage to
          <id-link name="Secret Tunnel" type="subarea" /> connecting the two castles.
        </p>
        <sub-area-title name="Secret Tunnel" />
        A tunnel that runs below the Fuller river and only the half-kings should be aware of its existence. It
        was designed to allow secret communication for the half-kings and could also be used as an evacuation
        route. Tunnel's other end is under South Edge castle tower and there is a secret hatch below the
        stairs. Knowledge of the tunnel is transferred from half-king to the next and its existence has to be
        kept secret from others. However, Hellä also knows about the tunnel because he spied his husband enter
        it one day. The tunnel played a major role in her affair with Armas as it made secret visits easy.
        Hellä also visited Armas just before his death through this tunnel, declared to him that he would
        never get her as his own and, with well selected words, drove him to suicide. She has a key to the
        room. She succeeded in her plan but made one mistake when she locked the door after her. She also took
        the painting of herself as she was afraid that it would raise suspicion.
        <sub-area-title name="Throne Room" /> A hall of stone that has wooden decorations with intricate
        carvings on stony surfaces. This creates an effect of coziness in otherwise cold room. A throne of
        dark hard wood with red cushion stands next to the back wall. Half-king Kekko is rarely here unless he
        has is receiving visitors. This space is mostly used by the court for secret talks as there are plenty
        of shady corners and covering pillars.
        <p>
          <id-link name="Valtari Sinuhe" type="monster" /> A stoic elf male guard captain with lean features
          and no sense of humour. Loyal to the king and king only. Doesn't take orders from Hellä or anyone
          else. Is responsible of castle's security. Most of his time goes into supervising other guards and
          inspecting the premises for possible threats. He is been tenser than normal during the last months
          of unrest. He doesn't agree with the half-king about everything, but follows orders without
          questioning. He thinks that the half-king shows as weak and needs to show his military more. Valtari
          believes in discipline through force. Failing DC 18 Intimidation check against him will lead to a
          fight that is interrupted by the king before anyone dies. You can use e.g. Knight to model him in
          the fight. Charming him causes him to admit his disagreements with the king. He likes to read about
          the old days and knows quite a bit of old tales, e.g. about plane switching witches. He even knows a
          legend of man called Otava Maaton who stayed in Pohjola and never returned. Otava told his story to
          everyone he met but no-one believed him and thought him to be a madman. In the end, he became one
          after trying to return for years. Finally, he drowned himself. Of course, this actually happened and
          Otava was trying to find Väinämöinen who is one of the few capable of such magic. He believed
          Väinämöinen lived in Iänlampi and Otava tried to find him by diving into the lake. Väinämöinen
          stayed hidden and Otava unfortunately drowned. Valtari is sure that South Edge ruined the river
          water.

          <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Priest Tiera" type="monster" /> Priest Tiera is a pleasant
          human female but loses her temper immediately if she sees blasphemy. She preserves relations to the
          major gods Ukko (god of thunder), Äkräs (god of farming), Tapio (god of the forest), Ahti (god of
          the waters), and Osmotar (god of beer). A true all-round pleaser of gods. She is displeased that the
          current environment does not leave the common people enough resources for worshipping and believes
          that they are being tested and they aren't passing the test. She is even less impressed by people in
          South Edge and talks about them with disgust in his voice. "Maybe they didn't poison the river by
          themselves but Ahti did because of their heresy."

          Two drunks in one cell, two muggers in separate cells, and one skinny lunatic male halfling called
          <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Mielipäivä" type="monster" />
          also in own cell. He is hysteric and utters incoherently about the return of "metsäläiset",
          "barbarians", and "giants". He has seen horrific things and horrific things were done to him. He has
          scars on his body that are covered with skimpy rags. He was found floating in the Fuller river on a
          log. A guard can explain the party where he was found from and what is his name but he doesn't know
          anything else.

          If the party has an orc or other exceptionally large PC, Mielipäivä could scream "GIANT!" and fall
          down in fear. He could refuse to speak until that PC moves further away. Utter e.g. in this order.
          The point is to act delusional and horrified and speak in whispers. I think you get the point.

          Mielipäivä is repeating poems he heard while being tortured in Kuurankaru, the "capital" of
          metsäläiset up in north. He was captured when fishing too far away in the north, at Viper's Rend
          river and was suspected to be a spy. He managed to escape due to unobservant guards and his small
          size but he had to jump into the river. He drifted on a log all the way to the Sword. Let's keep
          this as a secret for now, unless the party casts Alter Memory to delete Mielipäivä's traumatizing
          memories. <sub-area-title name="Royal Archive" /> A large and quiet library with a human female
          librarian that sleeps also there during the night in a small bunk between two shelves. The bunk is
          not visible to the entrance so if the party is loud they might wake her up. Royal Archive has been
          closed from visitors excluding priests, high ranking staff and the king. Knowledge is not for
          everyone. The party can break in if they can open the door lock. (See
          <a href="https://blackcitadelrpg.com/picking-locks-5e/" target="_blank">this</a> for more
          interesting lockpicking) If the party stays silent they might find a book called Masters Long Gone
          (Mestarit Menneet), which contains the legend of Otava Maaton. The party can also try persuading the
          librarian to help them with a DC 15 Persuasion check.
        </p>
        <section-title name="Endgame" />
        <p>
          If the party gets stuck investigating the death of Armas,
          <id-link name="Untamo Eteläterä" type="monster" /> will be found dead one morning. He has been
          poisoned with a poison called Midnight Tears, made from fallen meteors, by
          <id-link name="Kaino Kalpa" type="monster" />, Untamo's bastard son. He has been in contact also
          with North Edge court and declared his goals very openly. Hellä saw an opportunity in him and
          delivered a bottle of poison to his quarters with a note: "With this you remove half of what is on
          your way". Kaino mixed the poison into Untamo's meal. This poison activates at next midnight so that
          was when the half-king died and was discovered next morning. A medicine check will confirm that he
          was poisoned, DC 10 is needed to find out the used poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          The news will spread soon in the twin settlements and during the same day Hellä and Kekko will
          arrive to give the court their regards, but after the initial ceremonies Hellä tells the truth about
          her son and demands the throne to be given to him. Simultaneously she proposes that the two
          half-kingdoms would united into one. Kaino is of course first enthralled to become the half-king but
          Hellä's declaration will drive him into angry disbelieving shouting. I suggest Hellä finds some well
          selected words to put Kaino under suspicion, or maybe the party? If Kaino is detained, he should
          confess to the party in the dungeon what he did, but it surely wasn't his idea. The party can devise
          a plan how to return justice into the court.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the party manages to convince the South Edge court that North Edge court is behind their issues,
          North Edge soldiers will attack by the command of their half-king if he repeats his mother's
          command. If they lose the fight, <id-link name="Hellä Pohjanterä" type="monster" /> may try to
          escape. <id-link name="Kekko Pohjanterä" type="monster" /> may die. A lot of people may die. I leave
          this up to you. Hellä and Kekko are accompanied by 6
          <id-link name="Soldier of the Sword" type="monster" /> and
          <id-link name="Valtari Sinuhe" type="monster" /> and the South Edge court has 2
          <id-link name="Soldier of the Sword" type="monster" /> and
          <id-link name="Butler Kalervo" type="monster" />. Remember that Kaino has a strong motive to try to
          get Kekko killed. If the party solves Armas' death, they may want to revenge his death. If the
          evidence is presented to Kekko, he will eventually do what is right and imprison his mother. Untamo
          could present the evidence to Kekko in the tunnel. Kekko remembers that Hellä placed a new painting
          of herself on the corridor wall after Armas' death. He decides to give his mother to South Edge for
          imprisonment. Untamo will tell the party to visit Kuurankaru and see what is going on there. The
          next morning, Untamo will be found dead poisoned by Kaino. Kekko will never know about his true
          father and Kaino will become the next half-king of South Edge.

        <chapter-title name="Home of Darkness" />
        <area-title name="Kuurankaru" />
        <p>
          The capital of metsäläiset. A village built of stone and ice up north at the bank of northern part
          of Viper's Rend on the side of Winter's Teeth (Talvenhampaat) mountains. The area between the
          mountains is called Winter's Throat (Talvenkurkku). It is known for its ore veins which provide
          metsäläiset a steady source of income. Mining camps spread from the village along the mountain
          slopes towards north. Snow covers most the area and evergreen forests cover the valleys between the
          mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kuurankaru is crude but strongly fortified village, with stone walls and palisades. Fur-clad guards
          patrol the walls with javelins on their back. An opening on the side of the mountain back of the
          camp leads into a cave keep, a network of tunnels and chambers, that accomodates most of the
          residents in Kuurankaru. Ore deliveries from the mountains happen daily, which may offer a suitable
          way to slip in unnoticed. Another way is to dive underwater through the fresh water creek or the
          sewer creek.
        </p>

        <sub-area-title name="Viper's Rend Toll Station" />
        Another source of income for metsäläiset is the river toll station in the northern part of Viper's
        Rend, south of Kuurankaru. The guards there collect tolls from passing ships, usually ones delivering
        ores from the mountains in the north. Just passing the station costs 100gp without any load. Trying to
        pass the station without paying and alerting the guards causes them to start pursuit with a rowing
        ship and X
        <id-link name="Metsäläinen Soldier" type="monster" />. They can attach to the other ship by throwing
        iron hooks with ropes attached. If the party is caught, they are suspected of spying and will be taken
        prisoners and delivered to the dungeon of Kuurankaru.

        <sub-area-title name="Barracks complex" />
        <p>
          A village of barracks buildings and training fields where metsäläiset practice their fighting and
          maintain their weapons. Ore is delivered from the mountains to smelters and blacksmiths who produce
          new gear. It seems that they are preparing for something. If a metsäläinen is questioned, they have
          been ordered to use half of the mined ore to produce armor and weapons. The gear is not sold but
          stored in the barrackses. The party may find a pile of oversized armor and weapons in one barracks
          which is intended for giants.
        </p>

        <p>
          <id-link name="Joukahainen" type="monster" /> observes the area and visits the training fields
          often. The party should be able to spot him there. If they go too close to him, he may recognize
          them and try to capture them.
        </p>

        <section-title name="Espionage" />
        The party needs to find the information at the top of the Tooth in the hut. The may be able to fly
        there and skip the cave keep.

        <sub-area-title name="Housing Chambers" />
        <p>
          A network of little rooms along long corridors, each housing one family. During the days most of the
          adults are out working or honing their fighting skills. Few work in child care taking care of the
          offspring. The kids and the adults here shouldn't be a threat but they may alert few guards in
          secretly. If the party goes murdering anyway, just consider all people as

        <sub-area-title name="War Room" />
        <p>
          A room full of maps, letters and documents. The door is locked and guarded by one

          An underground dungeon with stone walls and one large cell. If the party ends up here, Juva should
          try to free them. He could e.g. bring them food and have a key baked into a bread.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Juva" /> is a human male undercover spy of South Edge court. He
          has been part of Kuurankaru for years now and become very devoted to his mission. He hasn't been
          able to connect the court after his colleague got captured. He should visit the party and request
          them to investigate the Tooth. He also thinks sabotaging the operation could give the Sword more
          time to interfere with metsäläinen plans, but they should focus on finding their true goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <id-link name="Loviatar" type="monster" />
          The queen of metsäläiset, the mistress of north. She is descendant of Louhi, the evil witch queen
          from the beginning of time and the one who created Pohjola demiplane. Loviatar shares Louhi's
          interests and tries to take Pohjola with the help of Perkele. For that, she needs to first find four
          pieces of Tursaansydän (Heart of Tursas), the key to Perkele's prison. She has ordered her people
          metsäläiset to search for ancient places for information. She already holds one piece of
          Tursaansydän and carries it everywhere. This piece was given to Louhi for safekeeping and has been
          passed on for generations. Loviatar has skin of pure white, black long hair and is as beautiful as
          every Louhi's kin has been (very). She commands her people with the help of Joukahainen, her
          advisor.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to stories, Loviatar lives on top of the Tooth, an unnaturally steep sloped mountain next
          to the Kuurankaru village. She hasn't confirmed this to common metsäläiset and she comes and goes by
          transforming to a large eagle. An eagle has been reportedly seen soaring over the Tooth many times.
          Usually she visits the Keep of Kuurankaru to give commands to village leaders but she may appear
          also to other places.
        </p>

        <sub-area-title name="The Tooth" />
        <p>
          A steep sloped mountain next to Kuurankaru village. Icy slopes are impossible to climb without
          suitable equipment. Inside the Cave Keep is a portal that takes to the top of The Tooth. On top is a
          protective sphere that isolates it from the cold and wind. On the mountain top is a green grass
          field with an old wooden hut. In front of the hut grows an aspen tree with human skulls hanging on
          its branches. They are skulls of Loviatar's ancestors, including Louhi. Loviatar can cast Speak with
          Dead and ask questions from them, although they rarely give clear answers. There is also an arch
          made of tree roots that is a portal connected to the one in
          <id-link name="War Room" type="subarea" />.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the hut the party finds sketches of Tursaansydän and Loviatar's notes of her research. On a
          table is a translation of an old text that reads:
          <read-aloud>
            The will of destruction was broken, Kapes cursed, moon brightly polished.<br />
            Was buried in ground, under Ahti, out of eyes, ears and minds. <br />
            But decisively not, as how can one desctruct desctruction without becoming one itself? <br />

            One was for the enemy, to remind of their kinship.<br />
            One was for the dead, to remind of what cannot be reversed.<br />
            One was for the gods, to be guarded with tireless eyes.<br />
            And the last for the one, who started it all.<br />

            Tahdon tuhon taittoi, kapeet kirosi, kuun kirkkahaksi kiillotti.<br />
            Painoi rakoon maan, alle Ahdin, pois silmistä, korvista, mielistä. <br />
            Vaan tohtinut ei harmia hävittää, tuhoa turmella. <br />
            Päätännön manasi muille, antoi äänen suille sukujen. <br />

            Yks oli viholaiselle, pohjolan suvuille suen.<br />
            Yks oli vainajille, jätille jälkehen, Vipusen viemisiksi.<br />
            Yks oli jumalille, vartijoille väsymättömille.<br />
            Ja viimeinen runojalle, ken kaiken alkoi.<br />

          The text describes the holders of the four Tursaansydän pieces. One was for the enemy, Louhi and
          metsäläiset. One was for the dead, and is hidden to the burial site of Antero Vipunen, an ancient
          giant. One was for the gods, and is hidden in a shrine of Tapio. The last piece is held by
          Väinämöinen who guards the prison. The party also finds a pouch of ten Bloodstones, Potion of
          Superior Healing, Scroll of Speak with Dead, and a single Sending Stone. The other stone belongs to
          Joukahainen who is not bearing it currently. When holding the stone, a party member gets a feeling
          that another similar stone isn't held by anyone currently.

          After a while, the party hears a faint noise that gets louder. It is the sound of thousands of
          ravens that are closing in to protect the home of their mistress.
          <encounter :enemies="[{ name: 'Swarm of Ravens', quantity: 25 }]" />
          dive towards the house through the protective sphere. If too easy, add some more! They crash through
          the windows, chimney, and open doors and attack the party. The party may have ten seconds to prepare
          if they hear them in advance.

        <section-title name="Escape" />
        When returning from The Tooth, the party is confronted by
        <id-link name="Joukahainen" type="monster" /> in a solitary location. He recognizes them and can't let
        them go as they know too much. He thinks he can't take the risk in prisoning them so they have to die.
        When he starts casting a spell <id-link id="monster-commoner" name="Juva" /> launches a crossbow bolt
        from a hiding spot into his shoulder and tells the party to run. Two more crossbow bolts fly and
        strike Joukahainen who flinches but doesn't seem to be too bothered. He casts a spell to heal his
        wounds. Feel free to make the escape as epic as possible. They could burst out of the gates, steal
        horses and ride into sunset. Or they can fight their way to the river and hide underwater. Or escape
        with the current. Your call.

        <chapter-title name="Giant's Grave" />
        The tomb of Antero Vipunen, a great giant of the past. The tomb contains one piece of Tursaansydän.
        The location of the tomb is known to archivists of the Sword. Religious advisors don't want people to
        access tombs.

        <chapter-title name="When Gods Beg" />
        Messenger of Tapio delivers a message that Loviatar is trying to break into the hold where they keep
        their piece of Tursaansydän.
