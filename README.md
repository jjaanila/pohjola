# Pohjola
An unpolished  DnD campaign inspired by Finnish mythology. Built using [campaigner](https://github.com/jjaanila/campaigner) framework.

[The actual campaign app is over here.](https://jjaanila.github.io/pohjola/)

Be prepared for inconsistencies, errors, typos, maybe even missing translations. I might polish this later if I decide to run it again. Meanwhile, you can this as a source for inspiration.
